# Testing-frontend-side-for-TODO-application
Software-Testing-Assi3-Frontend: which contains an html file, and JavaScript file, that work  as a frontend for the TODO application

For frontend side:
write test suite cases, either using robot framework, or selenium web 
driver, to test at least 3 of the functionality in the application, which are the following:

a. Add new TODO: verify that a user can add a new TODO, and after submit, it is added 
in the table and all text inputs are empty

b. Delete: verify user can delete a TODO, and it is removed from the table

c. Update completion: verify user can update the completion of TODO, by click the 
checkbox, and the table display it in the wright way.

d. Get all TODOs: verify that all TODO is displayed correctly

e. Get completed TODOs: verify that the table display only completed TODOs
Feel free to make any changes in the html file, if and only if, that will help in finding elements 
you need to complete the test suite case, and highlight these changes either in comments or 
in a separate .txt file
